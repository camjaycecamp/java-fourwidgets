this homework is being resubmitted because I made several errors with directory
access of class files and submitted the project instead of just the classes.
i've altered the directory pathing of the CC_SoundboardJPanel and 
CC_RotatingCowJPanel classes to be dependent on where the user's class
folder is located, as well as correctly implemented each file in the class
directory. i've also fixed the issues with the CC_MouseMotionJPanel class
not displaying the red color on the buttons when hovered over, and got rid of
the playSound method in the same class due to its lack of use.
